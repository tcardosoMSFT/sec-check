## Phase 1 — Core Agent Foundation

### [ ] Task 1.1 — Initialize monorepo root & workspace config `[P]`

**Depends on**: nothing
**COMMIT**: `chore: initialize monorepo root with gitignore, env template, and editorconfig`

**What to do**:

1. Create workspace-root files:
   - `.gitignore` — ignore `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `*.egg-info/`, `.pytest_cache/`, `*.pyc`, `/tmp/agentsec-port.txt`
   - `.env.example` — template for credentials (see content below)
   - `.editorconfig` — standardize indentation (4 spaces for Python, 2 for TS/JSON)
   - `README.md` — placeholder root README with project name and "Setup instructions coming soon"

2. File content for `.env.example`:
   ```env
   # === GitHub Copilot Authentication ===
   # Option A: Use CLI login (recommended for development)
   #   Run: copilot auth login
   # Option B: Set token directly
   COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN=

   # === Azure OpenAI (alternative to GitHub Copilot) ===
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=
   AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=
   AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=

   # === Development ===
   DEBUG=false
   LOG_LEVEL=INFO
   ```

3. File content for `.gitignore`:
   ```gitignore
   # Python
   venv/
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   *.pyo
   *.egg-info/
   dist/
   build/
   .pytest_cache/

   # Environment
   .env

   # Node / Frontend
   node_modules/
   .next/
   out/

   # Electron
   release/

   # OS
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db

   # Runtime
   /tmp/agentsec-port.txt
   ```

**Verification**: `git status` shows only untracked files, no errors.

---

### [ ] Task 1.2 — Create `core/` Python package scaffolding `[P]`

**Depends on**: nothing (can run in parallel with 1.1)
**COMMIT**: `feat(core): scaffold agentsec-core package with pyproject.toml`

**What to do**:

1. Create directory tree:
   ```
   core/
   ├── agentsec/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── agent.py      (empty placeholder with module docstring)
   │   └── skills.py     (empty placeholder with module docstring)
   ├── tests/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── test_skills.py (empty placeholder)
   ├── pyproject.toml
   └── README.md
   ```

2. `core/pyproject.toml` content:
   ```toml
   [build-system]
   requires = ["setuptools>=68.0", "wheel"]
   build-backend = "setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend"

   [project]
   name = "agentsec-core"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "AgentSec core agent and skills library"
   requires-python = ">=3.10"
   dependencies = [
       "agent-framework-core==1.0.0b260107",
       "agent-framework-azure-ai==1.0.0b260107",
       "python-dotenv>=1.0.0",
   ]

   [project.optional-dependencies]
   dev = [
       "pytest>=7.0",
       "pytest-asyncio>=0.21",
   ]
   ```

3. `core/agentsec/__init__.py`:
   ```python
   """
   AgentSec Core — shared agent and skills library.

   This package provides the SecurityScannerAgent and all @tool-decorated
   skill functions used by both the CLI and the Desktop app.
   """

   __version__ = "0.1.0"
   ```

4. Placeholder `core/agentsec/agent.py`:
   ```python
   """
   SecurityScannerAgent — the main agent class for AgentSec.

   This module will contain the SecurityScannerAgent class which
   uses the GitHub Copilot SDK to analyze code for security issues.
   """
   ```

5. Placeholder `core/agentsec/skills.py`:
   ```python
   """
   Skills (tools) for the SecurityScannerAgent.

   Each skill is an async function decorated with @tool.
   Skills are the building blocks the agent calls to scan code.
   """
   ```

6. `core/README.md` — one-paragraph description explaining the core package.

**Verification**: `pip install -e ./core` succeeds (dependencies may fail until venv set up — that's OK at this stage).

---

### [ ] Task 1.3 — Create virtual environment & install core dependencies `[S]`

**Depends on**: 1.2
**COMMIT**: `chore: create workspace venv and install core dependencies`

**What to do**:

1. From workspace root (`c:\code\AgentSec`):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
   pip install -e ./core
   ```

2. Verify installation:
   ```powershell
   python -c "import agentsec; print(agentsec.__version__)"
   # Should print: 0.1.0
   ```

3. Verify SDK imports (will confirm the pinned versions work):
   ```powershell
   python -c "from agent_framework import tool; print('agent_framework OK')"
   ```

4. If `copilot` CLI is not yet installed, install it:
   ```powershell
   copilot --version
   copilot auth login
   ```

**Verification**: All import statements succeed. `pip list | Select-String agent-framework` shows the pinned versions.

---

### [ ] Task 1.4 — Implement `list_files` skill `[S]`

**Depends on**: 1.3
**COMMIT**: `feat(core): implement list_files skill with @tool decorator`

**What to do**:

Replace the placeholder in `core/agentsec/skills.py` with the first skill function.

**Full code for `list_files`**:
```python
"""
Skills (tools) for the SecurityScannerAgent.

Each skill is an async function decorated with @tool.
Skills are the building blocks the agent calls to scan code.
"""

### [ ] Task 1.5 — Implement `analyze_file` skill `[P with 1.6]`

**Depends on**: 1.4
**COMMIT**: `feat(core): implement analyze_file skill for mock security checks`

**What to do**:

Add the `analyze_file` function to `core/agentsec/skills.py` (append after `list_files`).

    unsafe eval/exec calls, hardcoded passwords, and dangerous imports.
    It returns a structured dictionary with all findings.

    For the MVP, these are simple string-matching checks. In the future,
    this will be replaced by real scanners (bandit, semgrep, etc.).

    Args:
        file_path: Full path to the file to analyze.
                   Example: "/home/user/project/app.py"

### [x] Task 1.7b — Implement Configuration System `[S]`

**Depends on**: 1.7
**COMMIT**: `feat(core): add AgentSecConfig for customizable system message and prompts`
**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED

**What was done**:

1. Created `core/agentsec/config.py` with `AgentSecConfig` dataclass:
   - `system_message`: The AI's system prompt (who it is, what it does)
   - `initial_prompt`: The prompt template for scans (use `{folder_path}` placeholder)
   - `load()`: Load configuration from YAML file or defaults
   - `with_overrides()`: Apply CLI overrides to existing config
   - `format_prompt()`: Replace `{folder_path}` placeholder

2. Configuration sources (in priority order):
   - CLI arguments (highest priority)
   - YAML config file (`agentsec.yaml`)
   - Built-in defaults (lowest priority)

3. Config file search paths:
   - Current directory: `agentsec.yaml`, `agentsec.yml`, `.agentsec.yaml`, `.agentsec.yml`
   - User home directory
   - `~/.config/agentsec/`

4. External file support:
   - `system_message_file`: Path to file containing system message
   - `initial_prompt_file`: Path to file containing initial prompt

5. Updated dependencies:
   - Added `pyyaml>=6.0` to `core/pyproject.toml`

6. Created example config file:
   - `agentsec.example.yaml` with documentation and examples

**Verification**:
```python
from agentsec.config import AgentSecConfig

# Load from defaults
config = AgentSecConfig()
print(config.system_message[:50])  # Should print default message

# Load from file
config = AgentSecConfig.load("./agentsec.yaml")

# Apply overrides
config = config.with_overrides(system_message="Custom AI...")

# Format prompt
prompt = config.format_prompt("./my-project")
print(prompt)  # Should include "./my-project"
```

### [x] Task 1.7c — Implement Progress Tracking System `[S]`

**Depends on**: 1.5, 1.6
**COMMIT**: `feat(core): add ProgressTracker for real-time scan feedback`
**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED

**What was done**:

1. Created `core/agentsec/progress.py` with:
   - `ProgressEventType` enum — Types of progress events (SCAN_STARTED, FILE_STARTED, FILE_FINISHED, etc.)
   - `ProgressEvent` dataclass — Event data (current file, files scanned, total files, issues found, elapsed time, percent complete)
   - `ProgressTracker` class — Thread-safe tracker with heartbeat support
   - `get_global_tracker()` / `set_global_tracker()` — Global tracker for skills to access

2. Updated `core/agentsec/skills.py` to report progress:
   - `list_files()` calls `tracker.set_total_files(count)` when files are discovered
   - `analyze_file()` calls `tracker.start_file()` and `tracker.finish_file()` for each file

3. Updated `cli/agentsec_cli/main.py` with progress display:
   - Visual progress bar: `[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50%`
   - Spinner animation to show activity
   - Current file being scanned
   - Files scanned count / total files
   - Elapsed time tracking
   - Issues found counter
   - Periodic heartbeat events (every 3 seconds)

4. Added `core/tests/test_progress.py` with unit tests for progress tracking

**Progress Display Example**:
```
⠋ Starting security scan of ./my_project

  📁 Found 15 files to scan

  ⠹ [██████████░░░░░░░░░░] 50% Scanning (8/15): app.py
  ⚠️  Finished app.py: 2 issues found

✅ Scan complete: 15 files scanned, 5 issues found (23s)
```

**Programmatic Usage**:
```python
from agentsec.progress import (
    ProgressTracker,
    ProgressEvent,
    ProgressEventType,
    set_global_tracker,
)

# Create callback for progress events
def on_progress(event: ProgressEvent):
    if event.type == ProgressEventType.FILE_STARTED:
        print(f"Scanning: {event.current_file}")
    elif event.type == ProgressEventType.SCAN_FINISHED:
        print(f"Done: {event.issues_found} issues in {event.elapsed_seconds:.1f}s")

# Create and register tracker
tracker = ProgressTracker(callback=on_progress, heartbeat_interval=3.0)
set_global_tracker(tracker)

# Run scan (skills automatically report progress)
tracker.start_scan("./project")
result = await agent.scan("./project")
tracker.finish_scan()

# Clean up
set_global_tracker(None)
```

**Verification**:
```python
from agentsec.progress import ProgressTracker, ProgressEventType

events = []
tracker = ProgressTracker(callback=lambda e: events.append(e), heartbeat_interval=0)
tracker.start_scan("/test")
tracker.set_total_files(2)
tracker.start_file("file1.py")
tracker.finish_file("file1.py", issues_found=1)
tracker.finish_scan()

assert any(e.type == ProgressEventType.SCAN_STARTED for e in events)
assert any(e.type == ProgressEventType.FILE_FINISHED for e in events)
print("Progress tracking OK")
```

## Phase 2 — CLI Interface

### [ ] Task 2.1 — Scaffold `cli/` package `[S]`

**Depends on**: 1.7
**COMMIT**: `feat(cli): scaffold agentsec-cli package with pyproject.toml`

**What to do**:

1. Create directory tree:
   ```
   cli/
   ├── agentsec_cli/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   └── main.py        (placeholder)
   ├── pyproject.toml
   └── README.md
   ```

2. `cli/pyproject.toml`:
   ```toml
   [build-system]
   requires = ["setuptools>=68.0", "wheel"]
   build-backend = "setuptools.backends._legacy:_Backend"

   [project]
   name = "agentsec-cli"
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "AgentSec command-line security scanner"
   requires-python = ">=3.10"
   dependencies = [
       "agentsec-core>=0.1.0",
   ]

   [project.scripts]
   agentsec = "agentsec_cli.main:main"

   [project.optional-dependencies]
   dev = [
       "pytest>=7.0",
       "pytest-asyncio>=0.21",
   ]
   ```

3. `cli/agentsec_cli/__init__.py`:
   ```python
   """AgentSec CLI — command-line security scanner."""
   __version__ = "0.1.0"
   ```

4. Install: `pip install -e ./cli`

**Verification**: `pip show agentsec-cli` returns package info.

### [x] Task 2.2 — Implement CLI main entry point `[S]`

**Depends on**: 2.1, 1.7b, 1.7c
**COMMIT**: `feat(cli): implement scan command with argparse, config support, and progress output`
**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED

**What was done**:

Implemented `cli/agentsec_cli/main.py` with full configuration and progress support:

1. **Configuration options for scan command**:
   - `--config`, `-c`: Path to YAML config file
   - `--system-message`, `-s`: Override system message text
   - `--system-message-file`, `-sf`: Load system message from file
   - `--prompt`, `-p`: Override initial prompt template
   - `--prompt-file`, `-pf`: Load initial prompt from file

2. **Configuration loading flow**:
   - Load from config file (or auto-search for `agentsec.yaml`)
   - Apply CLI overrides (CLI takes priority over config file)
   - Pass config to `SecurityScannerAgent`

3. **Mutual exclusivity**:
   - `--system-message` and `--system-message-file` are mutually exclusive
   - `--prompt` and `--prompt-file` are mutually exclusive

4. **Progress display features**:
   - Visual progress bar: `[████████░░░░░░░░░░░░] 50%`
   - Animated spinner to show activity
   - Current file being scanned
   - Files scanned count / total files
   - Elapsed time tracking
   - Issues found counter
   - Heartbeat events every 3 seconds to show ongoing activity

**Usage examples**:
```bash
# Basic scan
agentsec scan ./src

# With config file
agentsec scan ./src --config ./agentsec.yaml

# Override system message
agentsec scan ./src --system-message "You are a security expert..."

# Load system message from file
agentsec scan ./src --system-message-file ./prompts/system.txt

# Override initial prompt
agentsec scan ./src --prompt "Quick scan of {folder_path}"

# Load prompt from file
agentsec scan ./src --prompt-file ./prompts/scan.txt
```

**Verification**:
```powershell
pip install -e ./cli
agentsec --version              # Should print: agentsec 0.1.0
agentsec --help                 # Should show help text
agentsec scan --help            # Should show scan help with config options
agentsec scan ./core --config ./agentsec.example.yaml  # Should use config
```

---

### [x] Task 2.3 — Create CLI README `[P]`

**Depends on**: 2.2
**COMMIT**: `docs(cli): add README with installation, usage, and configuration instructions`
**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED

**What was done**:

Updated `cli/README.md` with:
- Package description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples including configuration options
- Configuration section explaining YAML file and CLI overrides
- Table of CLI options
- Troubleshooting section

---

### [x] Task 2.2b — Dynamic skill discovery from Copilot CLI `[S]`

**Depends on**: 2.2
**COMMIT**: `feat(core): add dynamic Copilot CLI skill discovery with tool availability checking`
**STATUS**: ✅ COMPLETED

**What was done**:

Replaced the hardcoded external tool list in the CLI with dynamic discovery that mirrors how the Copilot CLI finds agentic skills.

1. Created `core/agentsec/skill_discovery.py` with:
   - `discover_all_skills(project_root)`: Scans `~/.copilot/skills/` (user-level) and `<project>/.copilot/skills/` (project-level) for skill directories containing `SKILL.md`
   - `get_skill_summary(skills)`: Returns counts of total, available, unavailable, user-level, and project-level skills
   - `_parse_skill_frontmatter(path)`: Parses YAML frontmatter from `SKILL.md` without requiring PyYAML
   - `_derive_tool_name(dir_name)`: Falls back to stripping `-security-scan` suffix when skill is not in the known map
   - `SKILL_TO_TOOL_MAP`: Maps 9 known skill directory names to their underlying CLI tool binary names
   - Tool availability checked via `shutil.which()` at runtime

2. Updated `cli/agentsec_cli/main.py`:
   - `print_available_skills(folder_path)` now calls `discover_all_skills()` instead of printing a hardcoded list
   - Shows source directories with skill counts
   - Displays each tool with ✅ (installed) or ⬜ (not installed) status

3. Updated `core/agentsec/__init__.py`:
   - Exported `discover_all_skills` and `get_skill_summary`

**Skills discovered** (from `~/.copilot/skills/`):
- bandit ✅, checkov ✅, dependency-check ✅, eslint ✅, graudit ✅, guarddog ✅, shellcheck ✅, trivy ✅, template-analyzer ⬜

**CLI output example**:
```
📋 Available scanning skills:
  Built-in skills (registered @tool functions):
    • list_files       — Discover files in target directory
    • analyze_file     — Analyze a file for security vulnerabilities
    • generate_report  — Generate a formatted vulnerability report
  Copilot CLI agentic skills (8/9 tools available):
    📂 ~/.copilot/skills/ (9 skills)
    ✅ bandit               — Security audit of Python source code for vulnerabilities using Bandit AST analysis.
    ✅ checkov              — Scan IaC for security misconfigurations using Checkov.
    ...
    ⬜ template-analyzer    — Scan ARM/Bicep templates for security issues. (not installed)
```

---

### [ ] Task 2.4 — Verify CLI end-to-end `[S]`

**Depends on**: 2.2
**COMMIT**: `test(cli): verify CLI scan command end-to-end`

**What to do**:

1. Create a test folder with known vulnerabilities:
   ```powershell
   mkdir test-folder
   echo "result = eval(input())" > test-folder/vulnerable.py
   echo "def hello(): print('hi')" > test-folder/clean.py
   ```

2. Run the CLI scan (requires Copilot auth):
   ```powershell
   agentsec scan ./test-folder
   ```

3. Verify:
   - Output shows files scanned
   - Output mentions the eval() vulnerability
   - Clean exit (exit code 0)

4. Clean up:
   ```powershell
   Remove-Item -Recurse test-folder
   ```

**Verification**: CLI completes scan and reports findings.

### [ ] Task 3.3 — Add `/api/scan` endpoint with SSE streaming `[S]`

**Depends on**: 3.1, 3.2
**COMMIT**: `feat(backend): add /api/scan endpoint with SSE streaming`

**What to do**:

Add the scan endpoint to `desktop/backend/server.py`. This endpoint should:
1. Accept a POST with `{"folder": "/path/to/scan"}`
2. Create a `SecurityScannerAgent` instance
3. Run the scan
4. Return results (initially as a regular JSON response)
5. Add a separate SSE endpoint `/api/scan/stream` for real-time updates

**Code to add to `server.py`** (after the health endpoint):

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import asyncio
import json

from agentsec.agent import SecurityScannerAgent


@app.post("/api/scan")
async def scan_folder(request: Request) -> dict:
    """

### [ ] Task 3.4 — Add graceful shutdown handler `[S]`

**Depends on**: 3.3
**COMMIT**: `feat(backend): add graceful shutdown with signal handlers`

**What to do**:

Add signal handlers to `server.py` so that when Electron kills the process (or the user presses Ctrl+C), the server shuts down cleanly.

**Code to add at the bottom of `server.py`** (replace the `if __name__` block):

```python
import signal
import sys


def create_shutdown_handler(server_port: int):
    """
    Create a signal handler that cleans up when the process is terminated.

    This is important for the Electron integration: when the user closes
    the desktop app, Electron sends a termination signal. We need to
    clean up the port file and stop the server gracefully.

    Args:
        server_port: The port number, used to identify the port file.
    """
    def handle_shutdown(signal_number, frame):
        """Handle SIGTERM and SIGINT signals."""
        logger.info(f"Received shutdown signal ({signal_number}), cleaning up...")

        # Remove the port file so Electron knows the server has stopped
        port_file_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), "agentsec-port.txt")
        if os.path.exists(port_file_path):
            os.remove(port_file_path)
            logger.info(f"Removed port file: {port_file_path}")

        logger.info("AgentSec backend shut down cleanly")
        sys.exit(0)

    return handle_shutdown


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn

    # Find an available port
    server_port = find_available_port()

    # Write the port file
    write_port_file(server_port)

    # Register shutdown handlers
    shutdown_handler = create_shutdown_handler(server_port)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, shutdown_handler)
    signal.signal(signal.SIGTERM, shutdown_handler)

    logger.info(f"Starting AgentSec backend on http://127.0.0.1:{server_port}")

        host="127.0.0.1",
        port=server_port,
        log_level="info",
    )
```

**Verification**: Start server, then press Ctrl+C. Confirm:
- Server logs "Received shutdown signal"
- Port file is deleted
- Process exits cleanly (exit code 0)

## Phase 4 — GUI Frontend (Next.js/React)

### [ ] Task 4.1 — Initialize Next.js project `[P with 4.2]`

**Depends on**: nothing (can start in parallel with Phase 3)
**COMMIT**: `feat(frontend): initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and TailwindCSS`

**What to do**:

1. From workspace root:
   ```powershell
   cd desktop/frontend
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir --no-import-alias
   ```

2. Configure API base URL in `desktop/frontend/.env.local`:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. Create a `desktop/frontend/lib/api.ts` utility for API calls:
   ```typescript
   /**
    * API utility for communicating with the AgentSec backend.
    *
    * This module provides helper functions for making HTTP requests
    * to the FastAPI backend server.
    */

   /** Base URL for the backend API, configurable via environment variable */
   const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:8000";

   /**
    * Check if the backend server is running and healthy.
    *
    * @returns true if server responds with status "ok", false otherwise
    */
   export async function checkHealth(): Promise<boolean> {
     try {
       const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/api/health`);
       const data = await response.json();
       return data.status === "ok";
     } catch {
       return false;
     }
   }

   /**
    * Get the base URL for the API.
    * Used by components that need to build custom URLs (e.g., for SSE).
    */
   export function getApiBaseUrl(): string {
     return API_BASE_URL;
   }
   ```

4. Clean up default Next.js boilerplate in `src/app/page.tsx`  — replace with a simple "AgentSec" heading placeholder.

**Verification**: `npm run dev` starts without errors, browser shows placeholder page at `localhost:3000`.

  // Track the current text in the input field
  const [folderPath, setFolderPath] = useState<string>("");

  /**
   * Handle form submission.
   * Prevents the default page reload and calls the parent callback.
   */
  const handleSubmit = (event: FormEvent) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    // Only submit if the user entered something
    const trimmedPath = folderPath.trim();
    if (trimmedPath.length > 0) {

                     disabled:bg-gray-100 disabled:text-gray-500"
        />
      </div>

      {/* Scan button */}
      <button
        type="submit"
        disabled={disabled || folderPath.trim().length === 0}
        className="px-6 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded-lg font-medium

      >
        {disabled ? "Scanning..." : "Scan"}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Verification**: Component renders in browser with input and button.

### [ ] Task 5.3 — Create Electron preload script `[P with 5.2]`

**Depends on**: 5.1
**COMMIT**: `feat(desktop): add preload script for secure IPC bridge`

**What to do**:

Create `desktop/preload.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Preload script for AgentSec Desktop.
 *
 * This script runs in a sandboxed environment before the web page loads.
 * It provides a secure bridge between the Electron main process and
 * the web content (Next.js frontend).
 *
 * The contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld() function makes specific APIs
 * available to the frontend without giving it full Node.js access.
 */

const { contextBridge, ipcRenderer } = require("electron");

// Expose a limited API to the frontend
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld("electronAPI", {
  /**
   * Get the platform the app is running on.
   * @returns {"win32" | "darwin" | "linux"}
   */
  getPlatform: () => process.platform,

  /**
   * Check if running inside Electron (vs. a regular browser).
   * @returns {true}
   */
  isElectron: true,

  /**
   * Open a native folder picker dialog.
   * This sends a message to the main process which opens the dialog.
   *
   * @returns {Promise<string | null>} The selected folder path, or null if cancelled
   */
  selectFolder: () => ipcRenderer.invoke("select-folder"),
});
```

**Verification**: File created, no syntax errors.

---

### [ ] Task 5.4 — Configure electron-builder for installers `[S]`

**Depends on**: 5.2, 5.3
**COMMIT**: `feat(desktop): configure electron-builder for Windows and macOS installers`

**What to do**:

Create `desktop/electron-builder.json`:

```json
{
  "appId": "com.agentsec.desktop",
  "productName": "AgentSec",
  "directories": {
    "output": "release"
  },
  "files": [
    "main.js",
    "preload.js",
    "frontend/out/**/*",
    "backend/**/*",
    "!backend/__pycache__",
    "!backend/*.pyc"
  ],
  "extraResources": [
    {
      "from": "../venv",
      "to": "venv",
      "filter": ["**/*"]
    }
  ],
  "win": {
    "target": "nsis",
    "icon": "assets/icon.ico"
  },
  "nsis": {
    "oneClick": false,
    "perMachine": false,
    "allowToChangeInstallationDirectory": true,
    "createDesktopShortcut": true,
    "createStartMenuShortcut": true
  },
  "mac": {
    "target": "dmg",
    "icon": "assets/icon.icns",

      { "x": 130, "y": 220 },
      { "x": 410, "y": 220, "type": "link", "path": "/Applications" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Create `desktop/assets/` directory for app icons (placeholder).

**Verification**: `cd desktop && npx electron-builder --win --dry-run` runs without errors (may warn about missing icons which is expected).

---

### [ ] Task 5.5 — Add native folder picker IPC handler `[S]`

**Depends on**: 5.2, 5.3
**COMMIT**: `feat(desktop): add native folder picker dialog via IPC`

**What to do**:

Add IPC handler to `desktop/main.js` (before the `app.whenReady()` block):

```javascript
const { dialog, ipcMain } = require("electron");

// Handle folder picker requests from the renderer (frontend)
ipcMain.handle("select-folder", async () => {
  const result = await dialog.showOpenDialog(mainWindow, {
    properties: ["openDirectory"],
    title: "Select folder to scan",
  });

  if (result.canceled || result.filePaths.length === 0) {
    return null;
  }

  return result.filePaths[0];
});
```

Update `FolderSelector.tsx` to detect Electron and use native picker:

Add to the component:
```typescript
// Check if running in Electron
const isElectron = typeof window !== "undefined" && (window as any).electronAPI?.isElectron;

const handleBrowse = async () => {
  if (isElectron) {
    const selectedPath = await (window as any).electronAPI.selectFolder();
    if (selectedPath) {
      setFolderPath(selectedPath);
    }
  }
};
```

Add a "Browse" button next to the text input that only appears in Electron.

**Verification**: Running in Electron shows a Browse button; clicking it opens native folder dialog.

---

### [ ] Task 5.6 — Desktop end-to-end verification `[S]`

**Depends on**: 5.4, 5.5
**COMMIT**: `test(desktop): verify end-to-end desktop app functionality`

**What to do**:

1. Build the frontend for production:
   ```powershell
   cd desktop/frontend
   npm run build
   # If using Next.js static export:
   # Ensure next.config.js has `output: 'export'`
   ```

2. Start the desktop app in dev mode:
   ```powershell
   cd desktop
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Verify:
   - Electron window opens
   - Backend starts automatically (check terminal logs)
   - Enter folder path or use Browse button
   - Click Scan
   - Progress messages appear
   - Results display correctly
   - Closing the window stops the backend process

**Verification**: Full desktop workflow works end-to-end.

## Critical Path (Longest Sequential Chain)

The **critical path** — the longest chain of sequential dependencies that determines the minimum project duration — is:

```
1.2 → 1.3 → 1.4 → 1.5 → 1.7 → 1.7b → 1.8 → 3.1/3.2 → 3.3 → 4.5 → 4.6 → 5.1 → 5.2 → 5.5 → 5.6 → 6.1
```

**Total tasks on critical path**: ~16 commits

**Parallelizable tasks** (can be done alongside the critical path):
- 1.1, 1.6, 2.1–2.4, 4.1–4.4, 5.3, 5.4, 6.2–6.5

## How to Use This Plan

1. **Pick the next unblocked task** — any task whose dependencies are all done
2. **Read the full task description** — it has the exact files, code, and verification steps
3. **Implement it** — write the code following the patterns in the task
4. **Verify** — run the verification command listed in the task
5. **Commit** — use the suggested commit message
6. **Move to the next task**

When multiple tasks are marked `[P]` (parallel), you can work on them in any order or simultaneously if you have multiple contributors.

## Appendix A — Coding Conventions Quick Reference

| Rule | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Python async** | All functions MUST use `async def` |
| **Type hints** | Required on all function signatures |
| **Docstrings** | Every function gets Args/Returns/Example |
| **Variable names** | Descriptive: `folder_path` not `fp` |
| **Error handling** | Explicit try/except per error type |
| **Resource cleanup** | Always use `try/finally` for SDK clients |
| **Skills** | `@tool(description="...")` decorator |
| **Session IDs** | Include context: `f"scan-{folder}-{timestamp}"` |
| **Long ops** | Use event-driven, not `send_and_wait` |
| **Imports** | Standard lib → third-party → local (blank line between groups) |
| **Comments** | Explain *why*, not *what* |
| **Function size** | 5-15 lines; break larger functions up |

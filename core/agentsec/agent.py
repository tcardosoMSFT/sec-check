SecurityScannerAgent — the main agent class for AgentSec.

This module contains the SecurityScannerAgent class which uses the
GitHub Copilot SDK to analyze code for security vulnerabilities.
Both the CLI and the Desktop app import this class.

Usage:
    agent = SecurityScannerAgent()
    try:
        await agent.initialize()
        result = await agent.scan("./my_project")
        print(result)
    finally:
        await agent.cleanup()

Your job is to analyze source code for security vulnerabilities using the
tools provided to you.

When asked to scan a folder:
1. Use the list_files tool to get all files in the target folder.
2. Use the analyze_file tool on each file to check for security issues.
3. Use the generate_report tool to create a summary of all findings.

Always be thorough and check every file. Provide clear, actionable
recommendations for any issues you find. Be concise but complete.

class SecurityScannerAgent:
    """
    Main security scanning agent for AgentSec.

    This agent connects to the GitHub Copilot SDK, creates a session,
    and uses skills (tools) to scan code for security vulnerabilities.

    The agent follows a simple lifecycle:
        1. __init__()    — create the agent object (no connections yet)
        2. initialize()  — connect to Copilot and create a session
        3. scan()        — run a security scan on a folder
        4. cleanup()     — disconnect and free resources

    Example:
        >>> agent = SecurityScannerAgent()
        >>> try:
        ...     await agent.initialize()
        ...     result = await agent.scan("./src")

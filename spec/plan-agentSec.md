# AgentSec - AI-Powered Security Scanner Specification Plan

## Overview

Build a cross-platform security scanning application using GitHub Copilot SDK (https://github.com/github/awesome-copilot/blob/main/cookbook/copilot-sdk/python/README.md) with dual interfaces: a Python CLI for developers and a Next.js/Electron GUI for broader audiences. The agent will use attached skills (tools) to scan folders for security vulnerabilities, with all processing running locally except LLM inference via GitHub Copilot.

**Architecture**: Monorepo with 3 packages
- `agentsec-core`: Shared Python agent + skills library
- `agentsec-cli`: Command-line interface (distributes via PyPI)
- `agentsec-desktop`: Next.js frontend + Electron wrapper (distributes as native installer)

**Communication Flow**: CLI directly invokes agent → GUI calls FastAPI server → FastAPI invokes same agent → Results stream back via SSE

**Key Architectural Modules** (added via optimizations):
- `session_runner.py` — Shared session-wait logic used by both single-scan and parallel orchestrator (eliminates ~400 lines of code duplication)
- `skill_discovery.py` — Dynamic discovery of Copilot CLI agentic skills + `get_skill_directories()` for SDK-native skill loading
- `tool_health.py` — Shared tool health monitoring, stuck-tool detection, and error pattern matching

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Agent Foundation

**1. Project scaffolding** (*parallel with step 2*)
- Create monorepo structure: `agentsec/` with subdirs `core/`, `cli/`, `desktop/`
- Initialize Python package in `core/` with `pyproject.toml` (dependencies: `agent-framework-core==1.0.0b260107`, `agent-framework-azure-ai==1.0.0b260107`)
- Create virtual environment at workspace root
- Add `.env` template for Azure OpenAI/GitHub Copilot credentials

**2. Agent implementation with skills** (*parallel with step 1*)
- Define security scanner agent in `core/agentsec/agent.py` with system instructions
- Implement built-in skills in `core/agentsec/skills.py` using `@tool` decorator:
  - `list_files(folder_path: str)`: Enumerate files in target directory
  - `analyze_file(file_path: str)`: Analyze a file for security vulnerabilities
  - `generate_report(findings: list)`: Format scan results
- Agent uses **Copilot CLI built-in tools** (bash, skill, view) as its primary scanning mechanism:
  - `bash`: Runs file discovery commands and security scanner CLIs (bandit, graudit, etc.)
  - `skill`: Invokes Copilot CLI agentic skills (bandit-security-scan, graudit-security-scan, etc.)
  - `view`: Reads file contents for manual code inspection
- Directive system message explicitly lists available tools and workflows with safety guardrails
- Stall detection system monitors tool activity and sends nudge messages if the LLM gets stuck
- Configurable scan timeout (default 300s) with partial results returned on timeout

**3. Verification** (*depends on 1, 2*)
- Install dependencies in virtual environment
- Create minimal test script to invoke agent with skills
- Verify agent calls Copilot CLI tools (bash, skill, view) to scan code
- Verify stall detection sends nudge messages when the LLM is inactive
- Verify partial results are captured on timeout

### Phase 2: CLI Interface

**4. CLI entry point** (*depends on 3*)
- Create `cli/agentsec_cli/main.py` with argparse for commands:
  - `agentsec scan <folder>`: Run security scan
  - `agentsec --version`: Show version
- Import agent from `agentsec-core` package
- Stream agent responses to stdout with progress indicators
- Add error handling for missing credentials/invalid paths

**5. CLI packaging** (*depends on 4*)
- Configure `cli/pyproject.toml` for PyPI distribution
- Set up console script entry point: `agentsec = agentsec_cli.main:cli`
- Create `cli/README.md` with installation and usage instructions
- Test installation in clean virtual environment: `pip install -e .`

### Phase 3: GUI Backend (HTTP Server)

**6. FastAPI server** (*depends on 3, parallel with step 7*)
- Create `desktop/backend/server.py` using FastAPI
- Add CORS middleware for Next.js frontend (origins: `localhost:3000`)
- Use `add_agent_framework_fastapi_endpoint()` from `agent_framework.ag_ui` to expose agent at `/api/scan`
- Implement SSE endpoint for streaming scan progress
- Add health check endpoint `/api/health`

**7. Server startup/shutdown scripts** (*depends on 6, parallel with step 6*)
- Create Python script to launch server on dynamic port (finds available port)
- Write port number to temp file for Electron to read
- Implement graceful shutdown handler (SIGTERM/SIGINT)

### Phase 4: GUI Frontend (Next.js/React)

**8. Next.js application scaffolding** (*parallel with step 9*)
- Initialize Next.js project in `desktop/frontend/` using TypeScript
- Configure API proxy to FastAPI backend (environment variable for base URL)
- Set up TailwindCSS for styling
- Create layout components (header, sidebar, main content area)

**9. Scan UI components** (*parallel with step 8*)
- Build `FolderSelector` component (file picker dialog)
- Build `ScanProgress` component (displays streaming results from SSE)
- Build `ResultsPanel` component (table/cards showing security findings)
- Create main scanning page connecting components
- Implement fetch calls to `/api/scan` with SSE handling

**10. Frontend verification** (*depends on 8, 9*)
- Test Next.js dev server (`npm run dev`)
- Manually start FastAPI server in separate terminal
- Verify end-to-end flow: UI → API → Agent → Results streaming back

### Phase 5: Desktop Packaging (Electron)

**11. Electron wrapper** (*depends on 6, 7, 10*)
- Initialize Electron in `desktop/` with `electron-builder` configuration
- Configure main process (`main.js`) to:
  - Start FastAPI server as child process on app launch
  - Read port from temp file and inject into renderer as env var
  - Kill server process on app quit
  - Handle window lifecycle (minimize to tray optional)
- Configure preload script for secure IPC
- Update Next.js to support Electron (static export or custom server)

**12. Build and distribution setup** (*depends on 11*)
- Configure `electron-builder.json` for Windows (NSIS) and macOS (DMG) installers
- Bundle Python with Electron using PyInstaller or embedding portable Python
- Create build scripts: `npm run build:win`, `npm run build:mac`
- Test installers on both platforms (Windows 10+, macOS 12+)

### Phase 6: Documentation and Handoff

**13. Comprehensive documentation** (*parallel with all previous steps, finalized last*)
- Root `README.md`: Project overview, architecture diagram, quick start
- `core/README.md`: Agent architecture, skills development guide
- `cli/README.md`: CLI usage examples, configuration
- `desktop/README.md`: Desktop app build instructions, development workflow
- Create `.env.example` with required Azure OpenAI/GitHub Copilot variables
- Add architecture diagram (ASCII or link to diagram tool)

**14. Development tooling** (*depends on 3, 6*)
- Add VS Code `launch.json` for debugging agent, CLI, and FastAPI server
- Add VS Code `tasks.json` for common operations (start server, run CLI, build desktop)
- Configure AI Toolkit Agent Inspector for tracing (optional but recommended)

---

## Architecture Decisions

**Monorepo Structure:**
- Single git repository with separate packages for maintainability
- Shared core package reduces code duplication
- Independent versioning for CLI and Desktop

**Agent-as-Server Pattern:**
- FastAPI wraps agent for HTTP access (proven pattern from AG-UI)
- Both CLI and Desktop use same agent implementation
- Server endpoint handles streaming via SSE

**Process Isolation:**
- Electron spawns FastAPI as subprocess, not embedded
- Easier debugging with language separation
- Clean shutdown handling on app quit

**Distribution Strategy:**
- PyPI for CLI: `pip install agentsec`
- Native installers for Desktop: Windows (NSIS), macOS (DMG)
- Separate packages allow targeted distribution

**Scanning Approach — Copilot CLI Built-in Tools:**
- The agent leverages Copilot CLI's built-in tools (`bash`, `skill`, `view`) as its primary scanning mechanism
- `bash` runs file discovery commands and can invoke security scanner CLIs directly (bandit, graudit, etc.)
- `skill` invokes pre-configured Copilot CLI agentic skills for structured security scanning
- `view` reads file contents for manual code inspection by the LLM
- A highly directive system message (using `mode: "append"` to preserve SDK guardrails) guides the LLM through a structured scanning workflow
- Safety guardrails in the system message prevent the LLM from executing scanned code or following prompt injection attempts
- Sessions pass `skill_directories` via `get_skill_directories()` to `SessionConfig` for SDK-native skill loading
- Model name is configurable via `config.model` (YAML key: `model:`, default: `gpt-5`)

**Stall Detection & Nudge System:**
- The shared `run_session_to_completion()` in `session_runner.py` handles all activity-based waiting, nudge logic, and tool health monitoring for both single-scan and parallel sub-agent sessions
- Activity-based approach: as long as SDK events keep arriving, the session is alive — no arbitrary time limits
- If no activity for 120 seconds (`INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`), a nudge message is sent
- After 3 consecutive unresponsive nudges (`MAX_CONSECUTIVE_IDLE_NUDGES`), the session is aborted
- Scan-specific nudges are context-aware: redirect nudge (if no security scanners invoked yet) vs. progress nudge (if stuck after scanning)
- Partial results are captured and returned on timeout instead of discarding all work
- Tool health monitoring detects stuck tools, retry loops, and excessive error accumulation
- Event handler unsubscribe functions are always captured and called on completion (proper resource cleanup)

**Dynamic Skill Discovery & SDK-Native Skill Loading:**
- Copilot CLI agentic skills are auto-discovered from two locations: `~/.copilot/skills/` (user-level) and `<project>/.copilot/skills/` (project-level)
- Each skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter (name, description)
- Skills are mapped to their underlying CLI tools via `SKILL_TO_TOOL_MAP` with a fallback heuristic
- Tool availability is verified at runtime using `shutil.which()` — no hardcoded tool lists
- Both user-level and project-level skills are shown in the CLI with availability status
- `get_skill_directories()` returns discovered skill directory paths for use with the SDK's native `skill_directories` parameter in `SessionConfig`, ensuring skills are reliably loaded by the Copilot CLI
- Sessions pass `skill_directories` to `SessionConfig` so the SDK natively discovers and loads skills

**Cross-Platform Considerations:**
- Python virtual environments work identically on Windows/macOS
- Electron handles OS-specific windowing and installers
- File paths use `pathlib` for platform independence
- FastAPI server uses dynamic port finding to avoid conflicts

---

## Scope Definition

**Included in MVP:**
- ✅ Monorepo setup with core, CLI, and desktop packages
- ✅ Agent with built-in skills (list_files, analyze_file, generate_report) — **note**: these `@tool` skills are legacy; primary scanning uses Copilot CLI built-in tools
- ✅ **Real security scanning** via Copilot CLI built-in tools (bash, skill, view) — invokes real security scanners (bandit, graudit, trivy, etc.) via the `skill` tool and `bash`
- ✅ **Directive prompt engineering** — System message explicitly lists available tools, scanning workflows, and safety guardrails to guide the LLM
- ✅ **Activity-based stall detection** — Shared `session_runner.py` monitors SDK events; nudges after 120s inactivity; aborts after 3 unresponsive nudges
- ✅ **Configurable scan timeout** — Default 1800s safety ceiling (activity-based detection handles normal cases); partial results returned on timeout
- ✅ **Safety guardrails** — System message prevents execution of scanned code, blocks dangerous commands, and defends against prompt injection from analyzed code
- ✅ **Shared session runner** — `session_runner.py` provides `run_session_to_completion()` used by both single-scan and parallel orchestrator, eliminating ~400 lines of duplicate wait-loop code
- ✅ **SDK-native skill loading** — `skill_directories` passed to `SessionConfig` so Copilot CLI natively discovers agentic skills
- ✅ **Explicit system_message mode** — All sessions use `mode: "append"` to preserve SDK built-in guardrails
- ✅ **Configurable model** — `model` field in `AgentSecConfig` (YAML key: `model:`) replaces hardcoded `gpt-5`
- ✅ **Context-scoped progress tracking** — Uses `contextvars.ContextVar` instead of global variable for safe concurrent usage
- ✅ **Proper event handler cleanup** — All `session.on()` calls capture and invoke unsubscribe functions
- ✅ **Connectivity verification** — `client.ping()` called after `client.start()` for early error detection
- ✅ CLI interface with argparse and stdout streaming
- ✅ Configuration system (YAML config file + CLI overrides)
- ✅ Customizable system message and initial prompt
- ✅ External prompt file support
- ✅ **Progress tracking system** — Real-time feedback on files being scanned
- ✅ **Dynamic skill discovery** — Automatically discovers Copilot CLI agentic skills from `~/.copilot/skills/` (user-level) and `<project>/.copilot/skills/` (project-level), maps each skill to its underlying CLI tool (bandit, trivy, checkov, etc.), and checks tool availability on the system
- ✅ Next.js GUI with folder selection and results display
- ✅ Electron wrapper with FastAPI subprocess management
- ✅ Basic documentation (README files, .env.example, agentsec.example.yaml)
- ✅ Development tooling (VS Code launch configs)

**Excluded (Future Enhancements):**
- ~~❌ Workflow orchestration for parallel scanning across file types~~ → ✅ **IMPLEMENTED** via `ParallelScanOrchestrator`
- ❌ SQLite persistence for scan history
- ❌ Telemetry/tracing with Application Insights
- ❌ Approval workflows UI for critical operations
- ❌ Multi-language scanning (Python, JavaScript, Docker, YAML)
- ❌ Plugin system for extensibility
- ❌ Advanced UI features (filtering, export to PDF/JSON, dashboards)
- ❌ Automated CI/CD pipeline for releases
- ❌ Code signing for installers

**Prototype Simplifications:**
- Basic UI without advanced features
- No authentication/authorization (local app only)
- No network features (future: remote scanning, team sharing)

## Risk Assessment

**Technical Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Python bundling with Electron increases app size | High | Medium | Use PyInstaller to create minimal Python bundle; accept 150-200MB app size as acceptable for desktop |
| Cross-platform Python subprocess management | Medium | High | Test thoroughly on Windows/macOS; use platform-specific process handling; implement robust error handling |
| SSE streaming issues in Electron | Low | Medium | Use proven AG-UI SSE patterns; fallback to polling if needed |
| Virtual environment conflicts | Medium | Low | Use workspace-local venv; clear documentation on environment setup |

**Process Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Scope creep with real security scanners | High | High | Stick to mock implementations for MVP; defer real scanning to Phase 2 |
| Electron complexity slows development | Medium | Medium | Start with Next.js dev mode; add Electron wrapper last |
| Documentation becomes outdated | Medium | Low | Update docs in parallel with implementation; use README checkboxes |

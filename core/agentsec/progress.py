Progress tracking for AgentSec security scans.

This module provides the ProgressTracker class which tracks the state of
a security scan and emits progress updates. The CLI and GUI can subscribe
to these updates to show real-time progress information.

Usage:
    # Create a tracker with a callback
    def on_progress(event):
        print(f"[{event.type}] {event.message}")

    tracker = ProgressTracker(callback=on_progress)

    # Start tracking a scan
    tracker.start_scan(folder_path)

    # Update as files are discovered
    tracker.set_total_files(10)

    # Update as each file is scanned
    tracker.start_file("app.py")
    tracker.finish_file("app.py", issues_found=3)

    # Finish the scan
    tracker.finish_scan()
